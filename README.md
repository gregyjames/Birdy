# Birdy
Birdy is a simple tool to analyze key data about your twitter following/followers.

## Libraries Used
1. Tweepy
2. TinyDB
3. Progressbar
4. Plotly

## Setup
In order to use the tools you need to have Twitter Api app registered. If you are confused on how to do so follow the guide [here](https://iag.me/socialmedia/how-to-create-a-twitter-app-in-8-easy-steps/). After you do so, create a file called config.ini and configure it like so with the data from the Twitter API page:

```
[API_KEYS]
consumer_key = consumer_key_no_qoutes
consumer_secret = consumer_secret_no_qoutes
access_token = access_token_no_qoutes
access_token_secret = access_token_secret_no_qoutes
```

## Contributing
At the end of the day every contribution is important regardless of size! Therefore, feel free to contribute to the project in any way that you can.
